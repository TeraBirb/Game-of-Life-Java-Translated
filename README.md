# Game-of-Life-Java-Translated

## A Java console program recreating John Conway's Game of Life. Translated from a previous C++ project.

Type out a 10 x 10 grid of X's and -'s, separated by spaces, hitting ENTER after each 10 characters. There are also copy paste examples at the bottom of the source code. Example:


X - - - X X - - - X

X X - - - - - - X X

X - X - - - - X - X

X - - X - - X - - X

X - - - X X - - - X

X - - - X X - - - X

X - - X - - X - - X

X - X - - - - X - X

X X - - - - - - X X

X - - - X X - - - X


Feel free to copy and paste from bottom comments to save time writing out the grid.

Enjoy,
